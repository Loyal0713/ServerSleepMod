# Server Sleep Mod

## Setup

Put this inside the ./mods folder on the server (you could put it in the client side but you can sleep by yourself in a single player world so do you really need this mod?).

## How to Use
Sleep. That's it. The server will send a message to all players to let them know who slept (so you know who to blame).
